Title: Heirarchical Partitioning of Diversity
Description: Heirarchical partitioning of diversity for community ecologists. 
    This package is the equivalent to the PARTITION software developed by Crist
    et al. (2003). PARTITION calculates alpha and beta diversity and uses data
    randomization (i.e., Monte Carlo methods) to derive expected values of
    alpha and beta diversity that would be obtained if individuals or samples
    were randomly distributed. The randomization also allows for significance
    testing of the observed diversity estimates. The statistical rationale and
    operational description of INDIVIDUAL- and SAMPLE-based randomization can
    be found in Crist et al. (2003). This package can utilize unbalanced data,
    can use both additive and multiplicative species richness and q-diversity
    measures of diversity, and both nested and non-nested sampling designs.

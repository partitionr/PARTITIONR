##Test of turnover and nestedness from random distribution

##Theory
##  Not sure if Sample-based randomization would work here, because it
##  inherently incorporates the structure of the sampling
##  heirarchical aspects would be tough to test
##  would need to develop new approach to this, I believe
###Mahon: Would it inherently change though? I think sample-based could still
###       handle turnover/nestedness. i-1 would be randomized across i+1 levels,
###       thus, turnover of i would still likely change.


##  Individual based would be fine
##    Use A Baselga's "betapart" package to calculate the turnover and nestedness
##    components of beta diversity

##Working through this now
##Will take a bit of time.
